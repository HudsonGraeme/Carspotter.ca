Some of you may have noticed that the forum is completely gone. I will not be making a new one as some hackers targeted the forum and posted lots of.. Things. As of today, i've deleted the entire forum and it's data. Apologies to those with legit accounts and anyone who visited the forum since May 7th.

Normal Service has been resumed, like i said above, the Forum section of the site is gone entirely and will not return.
