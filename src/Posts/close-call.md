Yesterday evening, while driving on an unfamiliar four-lane highway with two exits, a challenging situation unfolded. It was crucial to take the correct exit to avoid a lengthy detour back to our starting point, let's call it location A. However, there were two obstacles: Car A ahead of us and Car B in the adjacent lane. We urgently needed to switch to lane 3 to reach our intended exit promptly. Thankfully, our vehicle's design, courtesy of Mr. Musk, included a seamless one-second merging feature at no extra cost. With determination, I pressed the pedal, activated the turn signal, and executed a swift lane change. The car briefly alarmed us by attempting to engage Collision Avoidance, resulting in frantic beeping, but fortunately, it didn't veer off course.

Having successfully maneuvered into lane 2, a new predicament emerged. A stunning GT350R Mustang was positioned to our right. While it presented an excellent opportunity for photography, the driver aimed to take the lane 1&2 exit, precisely where we intended to go. The divider between our paths loomed closer. Suddenly, the Mustang roared, indicating its intention to make the daring move. Sensing the urgency, we applied the brakes. With a mere two feet of separation, the GT350 gracefully crossed the white lines, skillfully accessing its exit, while we executed a similar evasive maneuver in the opposite direction. Toward the end of the video clip, an unidentified voice, distinct from mine, can be heard stating, "Someone had to brake first."
