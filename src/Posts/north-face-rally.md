So, a while before the meet was announced, i noticed that [the king](https://www.instagram.com/vtm_theking_4/) and [Sparky1888](https://www.instagram.com/sparky18888/) had been posting photos of their new Pagani Huayra BC which was delivered to Miller Motorcars early this month. Last year, "The King" brought his 1 of 1 of 1 to the rally, so I was expecting him to bring either the 1 of 1 of 1 or the BC.

Fast forward. Wake up at 8:00AM on Sunday the 4th. Scout instagram for the latest news, have a look outside. At the rain that's steadily pouring down. Great. I'm relatively sure they won't call the meet off because A: Strada rented the track for the day, B: It's a rally, so they will have a schedule with reserved places at hotels and meeting points. The Pagani probably won't show - due to it being a hypercar that doesn't particularly like rain. Who knows though?

Fast forward again, and at ~10AM, I'm standing in front of Ghost Rider's SV, taking photos. The rain had stopped long ago, but the drag strip remained closed due to water on the track. The circuit was open and being well used, despite the water. Photos:

After about an hour, I overheard someone on the phone: "You're coming _now_?!" I turned to look at him, but found he was running toward the front gates. I followed, not wanting to miss whatever the commotion was about. After ~20min of standing at the front gate, some more car enthusiasts started noticing and joining us. Ten more minutes went by and nothing seemed to be happening. I'm used to standing at corners and just waiting for long periods of time, for a car that may never come at all. so this wasn't so bad for me. The shutter of my D3300 sprang into action and my camera screen was filled with a Pagani Huayra BC, and various other supercars. [Kingtasma.](https://twitter.com/hashtag/kingtasma?lang=en) I mentally chuckled at the fact that we're in Cayuga, and a >$2,000,000 Pagani hypercar is avoiding potholes in the disheveled country roads.

Immaculate describes the car, yet still does it no justice. This vehicle, this piece of artwork, of craftsmanship is absolutely striking. Seeing the automobile in person is absolutely incredible. The car resembles an Italian fighter jet, but with more class. The AMG V12 looks cozy, seated between carbon fibre and heat treated titanium piping which is capable of producing sounds that reflect the amount of work put into the engine by [Michael Kübler](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/real-passion-mercedes-amg-and-michael-kubler/) himself.

When the doors go up it looks ready to fly, and when it's driving it looks qualified to take a sharp chicane at 200km/h. Kingtasma went to the track for a photoshoot with [Twalt24](https://www.instagram.com/twalt24/) and [Toronto Exotic Carspotting](https://www.instagram.com/toronto_exotic_car_spotting/).

Here are some photos from the event in general.

All in all, the event was a fun time, and pretty awesome considering the Pagani. Thanks to [North Face Rally](https://www.instagram.com/northfacerally/), [Strada](https://www.instagram.com/stradajbr/) and [TMP Cayuga](https://torontomotorsportspark.com)!
