Porsche has been kind enough to host some cars and coffee events on the first Saturday of every summer month. These meets are very classy, and consist of good vibes only. The meet started off good, I arrived a bit early, allowing me to witness the arrival of some remarkable cars. First impressions:

I recognized the ACR from a previous encounter and anticipated seeing it at future meets later in the year. As I made my way to the back of the Porsche area, I was met with a captivating sight.

It was a breathtaking moment for me. This marked my first in-person encounter with a McLaren 675LT, and I couldn't help but be amazed. The matte black paint combined with carbon accents created an immaculate appearance. In my opinion, it surpassed the 650S in terms of visual impact—it looked aggressive and formidable. Moving on from the McLaren, I was captivated by the arrival of a very loud car—a classic Ford GT. Its owner parked it nose to nose with the McLaren, resulting in an interesting juxtaposition.

After that, the focus shifted primarily to Porsches.

That concludes my experience at the Porsche Oakville Cars and Coffee event. I extend my sincere appreciation to [Porsche Centre Oakville](https://www.porschecentreoakville.com) for hosting this fantastic gathering!
