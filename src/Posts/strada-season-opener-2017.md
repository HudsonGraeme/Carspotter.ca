Strada. The event was held at [Chateau Le Jardin Event Venue](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Chateau+Le+Jardin+Event+Venue/@43.7895421,-79.6289331,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882b3b30f280bda5:0xe48499ba868db97!8m2!3d43.7895421!4d-79.6267444)Â in Vaughn (Toronto). I had to leave at 5:30 PM for the 6 PM start. Despite Tesla's excellent navigation system, we failed to notice that the 403 highway was closed, and every detour we took was congested with traffic. Luckily, the driver quickly came up with an alternative route, and by 6:30 PM, we were back on track. It was getting dark, but I had my tripod with me, and my camera performs well in low-light conditions for long exposure shots. However, capturing videos without proper lighting would be challenging. I estimated I had about an hour of sunlight left based on the position of the sun. After a fast-paced journey, we realized the location was more than 7,000 buildings up the street from where the navigation was set. We took another highway/race track, and by 7:00 PM, we were almost there. While examining my camera, I noticed some police officers in the distance, which is not uncommon for car meets. In the meantime, a 458 Speciale caught my attention and triggered my carspotter reflexes.

The day has started off amazingly, then. In good spirits, we made our way onward. As we overcame the hill in the above photo, it became apparant that it wasn't just a single car pulled over but an entire rally. North Face Rally. Once again, my carspotter instincts kicked in, and I captured footage and photos of this incredible roadblock that resembled something out of "Need for Speed."

After getting tons of content there, we proceeded down the street, now a block away. We passed [Skyline Motors](http://www.skylineag.com) and found that the remnants of North Face were regrouping in it's parking lot. No content there. Finally - rolling into Strada. The traffic was at a standstill, every second car, a supercar. I parked at a nearby gas station, grabbed my long-range lens, and entered Strada. It was chaos. At least 500 cars in the lot, with a section cordoned off for North Face. Two legendary NSXs caught my eye as they entered the lot, looking pristine.

I spent a good 15 minutes walking around, capturing various photos at the event.

I then decided to go see what North Face was doing. After driving halfway to Skyline, we realized that the oncoming traffic was nowhere to be seen. After climbing a hill, it was clear to see why.

Without hesitation, I popped out of the sunroof in true carspotter fashion and started filming. We even pulled off into the risky turning lane to get more shots, and oh boy, did these cars look and sound amazing! Finally, I positioned myself on a sidewalk (while outside the car) and recorded footage of everything that passed by. It was an incredible experience! A big thank you to @stradajbr and @NorthFaceRally for making this possible!
