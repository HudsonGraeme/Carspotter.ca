So, a little while ago, i updated Tapp to 1.3 - I did minor stabilization and added some new features. With this next update, i'm skipping right to 1.5, then 2.0. This is because as some of you may know, API's only have a set amount of commands and GETs one can send/request. As of today, i've used all of the above. So, at this point, i'm going to work out as many bugs as possible and release Tapp 1.5 tomorrow or the day after. Any suggestions before 1.5? For 2.0? Comment!
