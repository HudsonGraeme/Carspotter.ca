# Cars and Coffee Collection

Hello again, folks!

Over the years, I have often found myself aimlessly wandering among the assortment of automobiles that fill the parking spaces and line the streets surrounding Engineered Automotive. This company generously reserves the first Sunday of every summer month for an event called Cars and Coffee. For those unfamiliar with Cars and Coffee meetups, a photo can convey a thousand wordsâ€”and I have plenty to share.

Essentially, Cars and Coffee is a delightful blend of one part coffee, two parts car enthusiasts, and three parts captivating vehicles. Upon my arrival, my attention was immediately captivated by the striking lines of the Mercedes AMG-GTR. The color choice was pleasantly understated, providing a contrasting touch to the overall body style, which falls somewhere between aggressive and awe-inspiring. The exhausts, nestled within the substantial rear diffuser, exuded a gnarly appearance. The classic AMG long bonnet flawlessly complemented the car, housing the large twin-turbo V8 engine that delivered an impressive 577 horsepower directly to the rear wheels.

All in all, Cars and Coffee offers a fantastic experience for any car enthusiast. There is an abundance of variety, and the passion for the culture is palpable. Furthermore, the coffee and doughnuts provided add an extra touch of enjoyment to the event.

Happy New Year!
