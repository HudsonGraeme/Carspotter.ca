If you follow my social media, than you might have noticed i've been doing nothing for the past week or so. Being a typical student, school took #1 priority as exams have been looming. Apologies for the speed at which this is being written. Exams finished today, specifically one hour ago. Therefore Carspotter is #1 on the list. Things to expect:

- Two or 3 awesome films
- Some apps for macOS(long story, will make a full article on it).
- Tons of cool wallpapers and screensavers.
- Lots of new content
- Some cool things, fun stuff added to the site
- More blog posts!

Thanks!
